# Dear Diary

## About

This is my super dumb version of a developer's notebook.

I like to try and keep track of what I work on and when, and this is a simple way of tracking that.

## Install

Put `deardiary.sh` some place in your path.  I like `$HOME/bin`, but do what you like.

## Use

    $ deardiary

That's about it - it'll fire up `$EDITOR` and open a timestampeed text file in $HOME/.diary.  From there it's up to you!
